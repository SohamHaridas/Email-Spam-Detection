Spam Email Classification Using NLP and Machine Learning 
I have done as the part of aicte internship 
This project demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). The model has been trained on a labeled dataset and implements text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms.

Project Features
Preprocessing of email data using NLP techniques (removal of HTML tags, punctuation, tokenization).
Feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF.
Model training and evaluation using supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes.
A terminal-based application to classify email text as spam or ham in real-time.
How to Run the Project
Step 1: Install the Required Dependencies
Ensure you have Anaconda installed on your system. Create a new environment and install the required packages:

        conda create -n spam-classifier python=3.9
        conda activate spam-classifier
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Step 2: Run the Terminal-Based Application
Once the model is trained and saved as spam.pkl and vec.pkl, run the Python application using the terminal:

        python app.py
    
Enter the email text in the terminal interface to classify it as spam or ham.
